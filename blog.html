          Overwatch League, The Future of eSports
        </button>

      <div class="card-body">
        The Overwatch League’s second season starts February 14, 2019. After a highly successful first season where the finals drew more than 10 million online views (not including broadcasts on ESPN and Disney XD), Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and its associated eSports league, hopes to continue to build upon its earlier success. Although the Overwatch League is not the most watched eSports game today (that title is held by League of Legends), I believe it has the funding, backing, and popularity to become the dominant player in the space.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Regional Based Teams: </b>The Overwatch League is the first eSports league to have city-specific teams around the world. This allows new fans to immediately have a team they can cheer for which reduces barriers to entry when you have to get to know players in the previous model. Furthermore, this encourages investment by ‘traditional’ team owners such as Robert Kraft (owner of the New England Patriots) and Stan Kroenke (owner of the LA Rams) which is critical for funding and clout.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Professional Sports Owners: </b>By having investors such as Kraft and Kroenke, the Overwatch League has deep pocketed partners who are experienced in business and sports and have a vested interested in ensuring the success of the league.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Slick Production: </b>Blizzard built a dedicated venue in Burbank to house Season 1 and 2 of the Overwatch League matches. It is a state-of-the-art facility with wall-wrapping screens that highlight the high-level game play. Furthermore, the production has experienced moderators and analysts with great shout casters for the play-by-play calls. This gave viewers a fun experience watching online and also followed a similar structure as professional sports with a halftime where analysts reviewed the first half and gave predictions for the second half. It was all very familiar.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Amateur Discovery: </b>The Overwatch League has a built-in amateur discovery system with the Overwatch Open and Overwatch Contenders. The former culls talent from the best players (not currently in the league) around the world into a structured tournament to showcase their skills and get discovered. If they perform well, they can be pulled into Overwatch Contenders which can be seen as the minor leagues with multiple teams around the world. From here, Overwatch League teams can sign the most promising players to their teams. This system creates a great pipeline of players and allows those interested in competing at the highest level an avenue to get there.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have faith that Overwatch will be the dominant eSports player in the near future and other video games will attempt to emulate Blizzard’s success to various degrees. With their first-mover advantage, Blizzard is able to lock down the major, influential investors around the world while continuing to build upon their promising start.

        Want to watch Stranger Things? Get Netflix. Handmaid’s Tale, you can find it on Hulu. What about The Man in the High Castle? That requires a subscription to Prime Video. This situation will only get worse due to the popularity of streaming platforms. Beginning next year, many of the major media companies are pulling their franchises off competing streaming services in order to populate their own products. Therefore, if you want to watch all these shows, it won’t come cheap and might actually become more expensive than a traditional cable package.
        <br>
        <br>   
        Streaming services don’t follow the same constraints of releasing shows in the Fall (fun fact, did you know shows come out in the fall because football season is the best time for advertisers?) but September is still a great time to create a binge worthy queue. The First (Hulu) and Maniac (Netflix) give us future, dystopian vibes with big actors and even bigger budgets. Amazon is throwing every ounce of promotional might it has behind Jack Ryan, and I’m excited to see Jim Halpert as a marine.
        <br>
        <br>  
        Below are the most prominent streaming services currently available in the US with their associated monthly cost for their most popular subscription tier.
        <br>
        <br>  
        Streaming Service Monthly Cost (most popular tier)
        <br>
        <br>  
        Netflix: $10.99 <br>
        Prime Video: $8.99 <br>
        Hulu: $7.99 <br>
        HBO Now: $14.99 <br>
        CBS All Access: $5.99 <br>
        Disney+*: $5.99 <br>
        WarnerMedia Streaming Service*: $5.99 <br>
        ESPN+: $4.99
        <br>
        <br>  
        Total $65.92

      <div class="card-subtext">
          * Assumed same price as CBS All Access since most comparable service currently on the market

      <div class="card-body">
        None of these streaming services provide live TV channels which cost an additional $35-$40/month to purchase a skinny bundle from various services such as DirecTV Now or PlayStation Vue nor does it include the high-speed internet package necessary to even operate these streaming services. Most cord cutters left the cable bundle due to the overall costs of the package containing channels that they barely watched. The benefit of having multiple standalone streaming services, although expensive to subscribe to all, is that they allow users to decide which service they will utilize. Lastly, the advent of streaming has changed the habits of the audience to not be beholden to the clock. Now the audience can watch a show whenever, wherever.
        <br>
        <br>  
        With the introduction of new services, there has always been movement from one extreme to the next as perception of value changes year to year. I would not be surprised if a new enterprise begins bundling the various streaming services together to form a new type of cable package. We have begun seeing the beginnings of such partnerships between various services such as Hulu teaming up with Spotify and other streaming sites being offered with mobile services. We are in the midst of peak TV which is great for consumers, if they are willing to pay for it.

          How The Nintendo Switch Can Learn From Microsoft’s Surface Line
        </button>

        The Nintendo Switch will be released in the US on March 3rd. There have been a lot of hands-on reviews and analysis done on the hardware as well as commentary regarding the potential lack of software. So instead of retreading what others have done, this article will focus on what Nintendo should do next.
        <br>
        <br>
        I see many similarities between the Switch and the Microsoft Surface Tablet. The Surface was first introduced in 2012 and blurred the lines between laptop and tablet. I thought it was an extremely innovative product when it was first released but it was held back by its software. Luckily, as the years have progressed, Microsoft kept investing and innovating the Surface line of products and have now developed crowd-pleasing devices.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nintendo is now beginning to blur the lines between home console and handheld with the Switch. Its potential roadblocks will also be its software, not in the sense of UI and operating system, but its games lineup. Although the Switch has not been released yet, I believe Nintendo can learn from the lessons of Microsoft. There is debate whether the Switch will be successful and only time will tell but I think Nintendo is on to something with its Switch strategy and form factor. Whether or not the Switch sells well, Nintendo should continue to innovate the form factor.
        <br>
        <br>
        Possible enhancements for the next generation Switch:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Slightly increase the screen size (similar to the screen size increase from the Surface Pro 2 to Surface Pro 3)
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; a. This could also help dual screen play when undocked
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; b. It will also potentially increase the joy con size
        <br>
        <br>
        2. When docked, performance is boosted to 4k or just better processing power (similar to the Surface Book with its dedicated GPU in the base)
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; a. This would allow third party games to be comparable with offerings on Xbox and Playstation
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Remove touch screen and IR sensor (to boost battery life)
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; a. If can’t utilize it when playing on the TV, no point in including it
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; b. Third party games won’t take advantage of it since Xbox and Playstation games do need that functionality
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Ensure backwards compatibility which should alleviate the lack of games in the next generation device (Similar to Xbox One in how they are starting to digitize Xbox 360 games)
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the main reasons why the Surface Pro tablets became a hit was due to iterations with its form factor but also the introduction of Windows 10. Its software was finally able to complement the hardware.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many of the suggestions above focus on maintaining Nintendo’s innovative design while allowing third party developers to easily port their games over from Xbox and Playstation. This would solve Nintendo’s biggest difficulty in fielding a comprehensive games lineup while enhancing the gaming experience.

          The Animated Movie Fad?

        Animated movies are experiencing a renaissance with all major studios establishing their own animation arm. Before 1995, when Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story, the only main animation studio was Disney Animation. There were some upstarts such as Don Bluth Productions, with films like An American Tail and The Land Before Time, but they were only mildly successful.
        <br>
        <br>
        So what changed in the Animation landscape? Animation was always viewed as entertainment purely for children. This view has been solidified with Saturday morning cartoons where characters and plots are written to entertain only children and not adults. Furthermore, Disney’s biggest animated hits were mainly musicals about princesses finding love. There weren’t deeper plot points or character lines that would intrigue adults.
        <br>
        <br>
        This all changed when Toy Story was released. It introduced the movie audience to a new form, computer animation, but most importantly, it was a great movie that adults — who were just bringing their kids to watch an animated film — could also enjoy and understand the various jokes that went over their kid’s heads.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the success of Pixar and later Dreamworks Animation with their Shrek franchise, other studios started jumping into the animation field with Illumination (Universal), Blue Sky (Fox), Sony Pictures Animation, WAG (Warner Bros.), and finally Paramount Animation. Not all of the listed studios are creating highbrow fare and their box offices reflect their output.
      </div>
        
      <img class="blog_images" src="2016 Animated Films.png">

      <div class="card-body">
        As seen from the chart above, films that will entertain a wide spectrum of the movie-going audience such as Finding Dory and Zootopia were able to bring in more than $1 billion in box office receipts. Then there are Ice Age: Collision Course and Storks which were produced with only kids in mind which brought in $409M and $357M, respectively in box office revenue.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I mentioned in a previous article, tentpole movies are developed with the 4-quadrants in mind. I would make the case that animated films create a fifth breakdown in the movie-going population.
      </div>
        
      <img class="blog_chart" src="5-pentants.png">
        
      <div class="card-body">
        For films such as Finding Dory and Zootopia, adults are excited to see the film. Furthermore, parents find them to be safe films to bring their young children to watch as well. That is not the case with action filled movies such as Captain America: Civil War or the Terminator Franchise where even though the fight sequences are tame, they might be too much for young children to handle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although some studios aren’t generating the box office bonanza as Disney and Universal are from animated movies, they are discovering other benefits from animated movies.
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Animated films do not require the same amount of budget as live-action movies since pay for talent is much lower due to only needing their voice and having flexibility in work scheduling
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Merchandising is more profitable since there are no royalty payments associated with using a real-life person’s likeness
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Characters don’t age and franchises can be revisited many years later
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Ability to develop new franchises for children who will grow up loving these characters. This can easily be seen with millennials who grew up with The Little Mermaid and Lion King still fondly remembering those films
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Can control how the character acts and is perceived. Live action movies are predicated on the audience liking the actor but sometimes a well-liked actor can slip up, most notably, Johnny Depp going through his divorce right hearing before the release of Alice Through the Looking Glass (which did not do well at the box office)
        <br>
        <br>
        In the end, as with all movies, quality is most important and these animated films still need to tell compelling stories that are entertaining and warrant parents to bring their children to theaters.

        Over-the-top (OTT) providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu all provide users the ability to watch their shows whenever they want and wherever they want (with internet connection). Furthermore, OTT providers are developing their own must-see TV with hits such as Stranger Things and Transparent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many traditional linear channels offer must-see TV but what they lack is allowing viewers to watch it whenever they want, wherever they want. This is mainly due to the nature of how they generate revenue. Traditional linear channels such as CBS, NBC, and ABC make money from commercials which are based on how many people are watching their shows live or from DVR up to 7 days later (sometimes more depending on the contracts). In order to maximize the number of individuals watching their shows, there is a set time when the show will air and hopefully it becomes appointment television — people must sit down at that specific time to watch the show. Therefore, if a show does not have enough of an audience, it gets cancelled.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would argue that if the show was not outright bad with a horrible premise, such as The Slap on NBC a few years back, it might be viable on an OTT platform. This allows individuals that might not otherwise watch the show at the designated time to still view it and can still monetize them through a subscription fee.
        <br>
        <br>
        CBS is partially pursuing this strategy with their CBS All Access service which a subscriber can pay $5.99/month (or $9.99/month for no commercials) and view all old seasons of (successful) CBS shows, some new exclusive series, and most recently, live NFL games.
      </div>
  
      <img class="blog_images" src="CBS All Access.png">
  
      <div class="card-body">
        Linear channels spend large sums of money bringing shows to series and then eventually, most are cancelled. By pursuing the route I’m about to outline, some otherwise cancelled shows can have a new life.
        <br>
        <br>
        If ABC had a site that charged a fee and housed all their shows that were eventually cancelled, would it be successful? Netflix is in an advantageous position since there is no agreed upon way to determine how many viewers watched any one of their shows but it is extremely easy to assess their revenue stream through subscriptions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The way for Netflix to be successful is to have many different niche shows in addition to broad spectrum show. These individuals can’t get their show anywhere else and will therefore pay the seemingly low monthly subscription fee and forget about it. Many shows ABC has cancelled had millions of viewers still watching it, just not enough to warrant it being on an advertising only model.

      <img class="blog_images" src="ABC Shows.png">
       
      <div class="card-body">
        As seen from the images above, the viewer numbers seem lacking for ABC cancelled shows as compared to the Netflix shows but there are some caveats. The ABC numbers only account for live viewing on television while Netflix encompasses up to 35 days of viewing. Furthermore, Netflix has the advantage of releasing all their episodes at one time allowing a viewer to watch as much as they want while ABC requires an individual to follow the show over many weeks which can affect retention. Lastly, ABC shows must compete with other broadcast and cable shows airing at the same time. Netflix episodes can be watched right before one sleeps. In other words, there is much less competition for eyeballs at a specific point in time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Granted there are many obstacles entertainment companies must face such as contract negotiations and building up a subscription base, but the potential benefits far outweigh them. I’m not arguing for a site specifically filled with cancelled shows, but instead suggesting it can be a complementary piece of a broadcaster's OTT bundle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Developing new television series are expensive and time consuming. Why not use the investment in a show that isn’t successful in a broadcast setting and instead repackage it for the OTT world where there is less competition for viewers since it is not ad-based and viewers are not restricted by the time they have to watch a show by. This also allows fans of a cancelled show to continue following the characters they have grown to love. Lastly, there might be the side benefit of viewers continuing to be invested in a show knowing even if it is cancelled on broadcast it still will be OTT. You never know, with this approach, maybe some shows that start OTT can pivot to broadcast.

        So how did Disney become such a goliath at the box office?
        <br>
        <br>
        To begin, Disney has 5 main studios: Walt Disney Pictures (their live-action studio), Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm, with the latter three coming through acquisition. These acquired studios have brought into the fold highly recognizable intellectual property as well as key talent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most people cite the acquisitions as the only reason for Disney’s dominant position in the film industry today but one key overlooked component is its recent strategy at Walt Disney Pictures.

        Below is the list of movies produced by each acquired studio since acquisition to illustrate the financial success each has brought to Disney.

        As for the two in-house studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios was in a rut before the acquisition of Pixar. They were churning out films such as Home on the Range and Chicken Little. Once Disney acquired Pixar, they installed Pixar’s leadership as the head of Walt Disney Animation Studios where they are now on a roll with movies such as Zootopia and Frozen.

        The last studio to finally start contributing to the Disney juggernaut was Walt Disney Pictures. Each year, the studio releases one or two big budget movies in addition to many smaller scale projects. For the big budget movies, there usually is no pattern as to what film is produced besides seeing potential in the script or director. Recently, Walt Disney Pictures has started to change that with a live-action remake of Disney classics strategy which grounds each film in a movie that has been successful in the past and comes with a nostalgia factor.

        <br>
        With the live-action arm of Disney pursuing a live-action remake strategy, movie going audiences finally know what to expect from each film as they already do from a Marvel film (a superhero flick with banter) or a Pixar film (high quality animation that touches your heart). There is trust built in and an expectation of quality and entertainment they have come to enjoy. In the past, Walt Disney Pictures had no identity and released many different types of films (similar to other studios) and therefore there are some big hits such as Pirates of the Caribbean but there are also big bombs like John Carter and The Lone Ranger.

        <br>
        Another factor to consider is the quality of the films that Disney has been bringing to movie theaters. This year, their top 7 films have an average of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. In an age of social media where word of mouth spreads much faster, this is key to driving traffic in subsequent weeks.

        <br>
        So how is Disney dominating the movie industry…by producing films people want to see and meeting or exceeding those expectations.

        Disney just had a banner year in the film industry being the first studio to gross $7 billion at the global box office in one year. All other studios have been looking at the Disney blueprint — collecting the finest brands and leveraging their IP to its fullest — and thinking of ways to emulate it. Yet studios want to copy Disney’s strategy and be different at the same time. This has led many studios to take a grimmer approach to movie making.

        The idea of a tentpole — a movie meant to make a lot of money, therefore usually has a large budget — is to attract the largest audience possible. If a story is too dark, families are less likely to watch which eliminates a huge population. Disney has been successful since all of their movies play to the 4 quadrants.

        Below is an example of the live-action fairy tales that were released by the various studios with the first coming from Disney.

        Although Alice in Wonderland is a darker take on the tale, it was associated with Tim Burton which has proven to be family friendly with darker tones. Alice in Wonderland was able to pull in more than $1 billion at the global box office while subsequent attempts by other studios have not achieved that magnitude of success.
        <br>
        <br>
        Subsequent Disney Studio live-action fairy tale films have followed their studio trademark and been more family friendly with Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast (which should do big business). This allows them to target a much larger population of movie goers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another prime example of lighter fare succeeding at the box office is Marvel vs. DC. Most recently, Marvel and DC have finally competed head on in a calendar year with Marvel releasing Captain America: Civil War and Doctor Strange while DC has released Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad.
        <br>
        <br>
        All 4 movies should be considered a success due to their profitability but DC has not been considered on par with Marvel’s output. Some people suggest DC’s attempts to be a “grim whirlwind of effects-driven action.” (Rottentomatoes.com).
        <br>
        <br>
        Disney has built its reputation on creating family friendly entertainment and showing that it was a savvy business move to do so while other entertainment companies are trying their best to stand out in a crowded environment but instead are sticky out in the wrong ways.
